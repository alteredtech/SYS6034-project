This preprocessing stage supported three critical modeling assurances:

Verification: Code correctness and logical transformations were verified using summary statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, time series of arrivals).
Validation: The dataâ€™s structural alignment with real-world EV charging behavior was assessed through charging rate comparisons, temporal clustering, and interarrival pattern examination.
Credibility: The plausibility of derived parameters was evaluated by comparing charging efficiencies and usage patterns across charger levels. Density estimates and fitted distributions provided further support for model realism.
